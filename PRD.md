# Product Requirements Document: To-Do List Application

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the product requirements for a simple To-Do List application. The application allows users to manage their tasks effectively.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

-   **Goal:** Provide a straightforward way for users to keep track of their tasks.
-   **Objective 1:** Allow users to add new tasks.
-   **Objective 2:** Allow users to view their existing tasks.
-   **Objective 3 (Future):** Allow users to mark tasks as complete.
-   **Objective 4 (Future):** Allow users to delete tasks.

## 3. Target Audience

-   Individuals looking for a simple, personal task management tool.
-   Developers looking for a basic example of a Node.js/Express/MongoDB application.

## 4. User Stories

-   **US-001:** As a user, I want to add a task with a description to my To-Do list so I can remember what I need to do.
-   **US-002:** As a user, I want to see all the tasks I have added so I can get an overview of my workload.
-   **US-003 (Future):** As a user, I want to mark a task as completed so I can track my progress.
-   **US-004 (Future):** As a user, I want to remove a task from my list that I no longer need.
-   **US-005 (Future):** As a user, I want the application to save my tasks so I don't lose them if I close the application (requires persistent storage).

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1. Core Features (MVP - Minimum Viable Product)

-   **FR-001: Add Task**
    -   Description: The system shall allow users to add a new task. Each task will consist of a textual description.
    -   Input: Task description (text).
    -   Output: Confirmation of task addition; the task is stored.
-   **FR-002: View Tasks**
    -   Description: The system shall allow users to view all currently stored tasks.
    -   Input: Request to view tasks.
    -   Output: A list of all tasks with their descriptions.

### 5.2. Future Enhancements

-   **FR-003: Mark Task as Complete**
    -   Description: The system shall allow users to mark a task as complete.
-   **FR-004: Delete Task**
    -   Description: The system shall allow users to delete a task.
-   **FR-005: Data Persistence**
    -   Description: Tasks should be saved to a persistent storage solution (e.g., a standard MongoDB instance, not in-memory).
-   **FR-006: User Interface for Task Management**
    -   Description: The web interface should allow users to add, view, (and eventually manage) tasks directly.
-   **FR-007: Input Validation**
    -   Description: The system should validate inputs (e.g., ensure task text is not empty).

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

-   **NFR-001: Usability**
    -   Description: The application (both API and future UI) should be simple and intuitive to use.
-   **NFR-002: Performance**
    -   Description: API responses for viewing and adding tasks should be reasonably fast (e.g., under 500ms for typical loads).
-   **NFR-003: Development Mode**
    -   Description: The application should continue to support an in-memory database mode for easy development and testing without external dependencies.

## 7. Out of Scope (for initial versions)

-   User accounts and authentication.
-   Sharing To-Do lists.
-   Setting due dates or reminders.
-   Advanced formatting for task descriptions.
